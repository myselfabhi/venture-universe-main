      "explanation": "Humanity now has a spacecraft orbiting Venus.  The robotic Venus Express spacecraft launched by the European Space Agency in 2005 November arrived at Venus in 2006 April.  Venus Express is now orbiting Earth's sister planet and returning pictures.  Pictured above is a false-color, time-lapse movie in ultraviolet light captured by the Venus Express spacecraft as it flew over Venus' northern hemisphere in late May.  Venus Express is scheduled to orbit Venus for three years and collect data that might help in answering questions that include why Venus continually generates hurricane-force winds, why Venus became so hot in the past, and if there is any current volcanic activity on Venus.  It is hoped that a better understanding of Venus's hot and inhospitable climate will help humanity better understand Earth's climate as well.",

      "explanation": "Centered in a well-composed celestial still life, pretty, blue vdB 9 is the 9th object in Sidney van den Bergh's 1966 catalog of reflection nebulae. It shares this telescopic field of view, about twice the size of a full moon on the sky, with stars and dark, obscuring dust clouds in the northerly constellation Cassiopeia. Cosmic dust is preferentially reflecting blue starlight from embedded, hot star SU Cassiopeiae, giving vdB 9 the characteristic bluish tint associated with a classical reflection nebula. SU Cas is a Cepheid variable star, though even at its brightest it is just too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. Still Cepheids play an important role in determining distances in our galaxy and beyond. At the star's well-known distance of 1,540 light-years, this cosmic canvas would be about 24 light-years across.",

      "explanation": "Your arm on Mars has unusual powers.  For one thing it is nearly 2 meters long, has a scoop and grapple built into its hand, and has a camera built into its forearm.  For another, it will soon deploy your ear -- a sensitive seismometer that will listen for distant rumblings -- onto the surface of Mars.  Your SEISmomet-ear is the orange box in the foreground, while the gray dome behind it will be its protective cover.  Your arm is attached to the InSight robotic lander that touched down on Mars two weeks ago. Somewhat unexpectedly, your ear has already heard something -- slight vibrations caused by the Martian wind flowing over the solar panels.  Light from the Sun is being collected by the solar panels, part of one being visible on the far right. Actually, at the present time, you have two arms operating on Mars, but they are separated by about 600 kilometers. That's because your other active arm is connected to the Curiosity rover exploring a distant crater.  Taken a week ago, rusty soil and rocks are visible in the featured image beyond Insight, as well as the orange sky of Mars.   Follow APOD on: Instagram, Facebook,  Reddit, or Twitter",
